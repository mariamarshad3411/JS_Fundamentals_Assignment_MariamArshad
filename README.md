# JS Fundamentals Assignment - Mariam Arshad


This repository contains the completed JavaScript fundamentals assignment for my client-side programming class. The project covers basic JavaScript concepts such as:
- Variables & Data Types
- Type Casting
- Operators
- User Input
- Conditionals
- Loops


- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for displaying the results.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript code that handles logic for variables, user input, conditionals, and loops.


1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Follow the prompts to enter data, such as your name, age, and numbers for calculations.
3. The results will be displayed directly on the webpage.
